Welcome!

This repository showcases a data analytics project focused on exploring and modeling long-term trends in major U.S. stock market indexes. The work highlights practical Python skills (data cleaning, visualization, and regression modeling), as well as techniques learned in graduate-level analytics coursework.


The project covers:

Collecting and organizing historical index data

Exploratory data analysis and visualization

Implementing linear, ridge, lasso, and polynomial regression

Evaluating model performance with metrics such as R² and RMSE

Interpreting results to understand long-term market behavior


The included Excel file updates automatically each day, displaying the latest closing values for each index alongside their daily return percentages. Each index has its own tab that compares actual values to the model’s predicted results. Additional visualizations and the full analysis workflow are available in the Jupyter Notebook.

This project also uses a YAML configuration inspired by Simon Willison’s approach to automated data collection. More details can be found here: https://simonwillison.net/2020/Oct/9/git-scraping/
